# How to Deploy POA Bridge Contracts

In order to deploy bridge contracts you must run `npm install` to install all dependencies. For more information, see the [project README](../README.md).

1. Compile the source contracts.
```
cd ..
npm run compile
```

2. Create a `.env` file.
```
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env
```

3. If necessary, deploy and configure a multi-sig wallet contract to manage the bridge contracts after deployment. We have not audited any wallets for security, but have used https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet/ with success.

4. Adjust the parameters in the `.env` file depending on the desired bridge mode. See below for comments related to each parameter.

5. Add funds to the deployment accounts in both the Home and Foreign networks.

6. Run `npm run deploy`.

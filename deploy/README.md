# How to deploy POA bridge contracts

1. compile source contracts:
```
cd ..
npm run compile
```

2. create `.env` file
`cp .env.example .env`

3. if it is necessary, deploy and configure a multi-sig wallet contract which will
   be used to manage the bridge contracts after deployment.

4. adjust parameters in the `.env` file depending on the desired bridge mode 

5. fill the balance of the deployment account in Home and Foreign networks 

6. run `node deploy.js` 

## Configuration for `NATIVE-TO-ERC` Bridge mode  

Here is an example of an `.env` file for `native-to-erc` bridge mode.
